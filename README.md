# Payment-Gateway-Simulation-APIs
A Spring Boot REST API that simulates dealer subscription payment processing with PostgreSQL as the database. The system supports UPI, Card, and NetBanking payments, stores payment records with transaction status, and auto-updates the status after 5 seconds to mimic a real payment gateway callback.
